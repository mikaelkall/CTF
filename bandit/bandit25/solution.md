# Bandit Level 25 â†’ Level 26 - Final level.

## Writeup

Have not been able to automate this level yet as it involved some keyboard shortcuts to solve.
So here is a quick writeup

```
$ ssh -l bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 ( pass: uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG )
```

Make terminal as smal as possible as the shell for this level is text file and we need to trigger more.


```
$ ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost
```

Press ctr+V to trigger visual mode in more

Type

:!/bin/sh

Congratulation level is solved.
