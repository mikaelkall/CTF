## Welcome

Here you will find pwnables for beginners. Most of the challenges were created for an internal event at our ctf team OpenToAll. Eventually I grew fond of the idea of hosting them publicly, so this website was born. Some challenges will have multiple variations with progressive difficulty, I hope you enjoy them all.

Upon completion of all challenges you will unlock a new feature: permission to upload your own challenges. From the ADD CHALLENGE menu, upload the source, compiler options along with a PoC. All of the uploads will be moderated and only the creative ones will be chosen.

## Rules

* Do not share solutions or flags publicly.
* Do not brute force (too much).
* If you find a vulnerability that would impact the website/challenges, don't ruin the fun for everybody, report it to us.
* Most importantly, use common sense and show good sportsmanship.
