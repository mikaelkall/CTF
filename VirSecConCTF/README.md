# VIRSECCON

After a serious influx of requests, I've made the VirSecCon CTF challenges once again visible and accessible! NOTE that I will NOT be 
actively maintaining these. If they are borked or go down, you can notify me, but it will NOT be my top priority to revive them.
 I do not know how much longer I will leave these running, but I think one or two weeks is a good start. 
 Hosting this does still cost some coin, so if you are willing to support, I would love you forever (not that I don't already) at https://www.paypal.me/johnhammond010. Happy hacking!!
